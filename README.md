You can download the file here: http://sdrv.ms/1d2Sn0j

In your mission PBO, create a new folder called "map addons".  Place the balota_addon.SQF in the folder you made.

Next open your init.sqf, also in the root of your mission PBO, and add this line:

[] execVM "YourFolderYouMade\balota_addon.sqf"; at the bottom of your init.sqf .

Final step is to repack your mission PBO and upload to the server.
